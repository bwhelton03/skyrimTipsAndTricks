		<p> Here are some things to do in Skyrim the Elder Scrolls V this is including the Dawngaurd DLC! Aslo here are some easy leveling guides. </p>

		<p> no.1. Transform into a vampire lord as you accept the gift of the werewolf for the first time, as fast as you can transform back to a human. Then
			activite both transformations almost similtaniously if done correctly you become a werewolf/vampire hybrid and have the mixed effects of both creatures.
		</p>

		<p> no.2. Get Arngier the Greybeard to use the Ice form shout on you on the edge of the throat of the world mountain. You go flying so fast and it's 
stupidly funny! WARNING! Make sure you save before aggrovating Arngier as he is lvl 135 and is OP as crap.</p>

		<p> no.3. to level up one-handed easily you can set difficulty to legendary and buy a horse to abuse, you sick psycopath.
Just keep hitting the horse until its nearly dead then wait 1 hour and repeat this method works for any offensive damage skill.</p>

		<p> To level up heavy/light armor just find a skeever and afk so that your armor increases. </p>

		<p> To level conjuration just soul trap the absolute crap out of a corpse. </p>
		
		<p> To level restoration you need to get the spell equillebrium and keep casting a healing spell like grand or fast healing! !WARNING! The spell equilibrium can kill you if your not careful. </p>
